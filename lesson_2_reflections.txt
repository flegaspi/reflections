What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The folder in which I ran "git init" gets a folder called ".git". From here on out, Git can implemenent its version tracking methods.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is like an intermediate between the working directory and committs. I can prepare multiple files for a single committ in the stagin area.
